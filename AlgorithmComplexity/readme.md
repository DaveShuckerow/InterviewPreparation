These examples all use Python3!

Iterative Analysis
===================
Iterative Analysis demonstrates constant time, logarithmic, linear, linearithmic, square, and cubic complexities.

Recursive Analysis
==================
Recursive Analysis demonstrates constant time, logarithmic, linear, exponential, and factorial complexities.

It should be noted that it is possible to implement a function of any complexity via iteration or through recursion.  Iterative and Recursive functions are capable of computing the same results in identical time complexities--all iterative algorithms can be implemented with recursion and vice-versa.  Occasionally recursion becomes a memory consumption risk, however for many algorithms, such as the 8-queens problem, recursive approaches may be more readable, and significantly easier for a programmer to write and understand.
